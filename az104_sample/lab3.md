# Case Study 3: Securing Sensitive Data with Storage Account Encryption

Your organization handles highly sensitive data that requires strong encryption at rest. You need to ensure that your Azure Storage account meets these security requirements by configuring encryption with a customer-managed key.

## Task:

- Create an Azure Key Vault.
- Generate a key within the Key Vault.
- Configure your Azure Storage account to use the key from the Key Vault for encryption.
- Verify that the storage account is encrypted with the customer-managed key.

## Skills Tested:

- Configure storage account encryption

## Tools:

For this exercise, you can choose between using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell. I recommend using the Azure CLI for a more streamlined experience.

Before you begin, would you like a quick overview of customer-managed keys and how they differ from Microsoft-managed keys?

Once you've completed the task, explain how you would verify that the storage account is indeed encrypted with your customer-managed key. What specific properties or settings would you examine?
