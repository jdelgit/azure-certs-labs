# Case Study 4: Optimizing Storage for Different Data Types

Your organization has two primary data storage needs:

    File Shares for Collaboration: A team needs a shared file storage solution accessible from multiple virtual machines.
    Object Storage for Images: An application requires a scalable object storage solution to store and serve images.

## Task:

- Create an Azure file share within your storage account and demonstrate how to mount it on a virtual machine.
- Create a blob container within your storage account and configure its access tier for optimal cost efficiency.
- Upload an image to the blob container and verify its access tier.

## Skills Tested:

- Configure Azure Files and Azure Blob Storage
- Configure storage tiers

## Tools:

For this exercise, you can use a combination of the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell. I recommend using the Azure CLI for both tasks to maintain consistency.

Before you begin, would you like a quick recap of the differences between Azure Files and Azure Blob Storage, or a refresher on storage access tiers?

Once you've completed the task, explain how you would choose the most appropriate access tier for a blob container based on its expected usage patterns. What factors would you consider?
