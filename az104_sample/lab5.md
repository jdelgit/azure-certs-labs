# Case Study 5: Deploying a Scalable Web Application

Your organization is deploying a web application that requires high availability and scalability. You need to create a virtual machine scale set to host the application and ensure that it can handle varying traffic loads.

## Task:

- Create a virtual machine scale set with a minimum of two instances.
- Configure auto-scaling based on CPU utilization.
- Deploy a simple web application to the virtual machine scale set.
- Test the auto-scaling functionality by generating CPU load.

## Skills Tested:

- Deploy and configure an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets
- Configure scaling for an App Service plan

## Tools:

For this exercise, I recommend using the Azure CLI to create and configure the virtual machine scale set.

Before you begin, would you like a quick overview of virtual machine scale sets and their benefits, or a refresher on auto-scaling concepts?

Once you've completed the task, explain how you would monitor the auto-scaling activity and ensure that the virtual machine scale set is responding correctly to changes in CPU utilization. What metrics and tools would you use?
