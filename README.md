# Azure Administrator Practice labs

## Purpose

This repository is designed to aid in studying for Azure certifications and practicing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) on Azure. It provides:

- Hands-on lab exercises generated through prompts
- Practical experience with Azure resources and services
- Implementation tasks of varying difficulty and time requirements

## How to Use

### Lab Prompts

Files with the `_prompt.md` suffix contain prompts for generating exercises for specific Azure certifications:

1. Find the appropriate prompt file for your certification path
2. Copy and paste the content into a Large Language Model (LLM) such as Gemini 2.0 Flash (recommended)
3. The LLM will generate customized lab exercises for you to complete
4. Continue the conversation with the LLM for guidance while solving the labs

> **Note**: Gemini 2.0 Flash in learning-coach mode has been tested with good results


Some example labs can be seen in the az104 folder

### Development Environment

This repository includes a devcontainer with the following tools pre-installed:

- Azure CLI for managing Azure resources via command line
- PowerShell with Azure module for scripting and automation
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code implementation

The devcontainer provides a consistent environment for completing the labs without requiring local installation of these tools.
